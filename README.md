# MindBike Mindmapping

MindBike is a Mindmap viewer and editor. It is still in alpha/beta-state but usable for mindmaps without extra-features.  It reads and displays Mindmaps in the Freemind/Freeplane Format (*.mm). Its possible to edit and save the mindmaps in the same format, so they are still compatible with Freemind or Freeplane. It is written in Python + Kivy and thus runs under Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and MacOS - but the main target ist Android. It is the best mindmapping-application for Freeplane and Freemind files on Android to date (though that doesn't mean much...). [Wikipedia links here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreePlane).


## Features ##
 * Displaying and Editing of Mindmaps
 * Fully compatible with Freemind and Freeplane
   * Mindbike can't display or edit notes, icons, node-details and node-attributes. But it will preserve them, so they don't get lost by opening/saving *.mm-Files
   * no rich-text yet. No unicode on Android (should be solved in time)
 * Collaborative editing: Mindbike can merge two mindmaps easily. If you have two copies of the same map - one on your desktop and one on your smartphone - you can add nodes on both maps and merge them later. After merging you have all the new nodes of both maps in both maps! (No additional software (like Git) required)
 * Hashtags. Add #hashtags in your node-text to easily access nodes with similar content. Mindbike will generate a #Hashmap that bundles all the nodes with the same #hashtags. Use #hashtag:subtag to build subgroups. This enables an easy GTD (GettingThingsDone) workflow.
