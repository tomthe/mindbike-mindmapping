# MindBike Mindmapping #

MindBike is a Mindmap viewer and editor. It reads and displays Mindmaps in the Freemind/Freeplane Format (*.mm). Its possible to edit and save the mindmaps in the same format, so they are still compatible with Freemind or Freeplane.

### Multi-Platform ###

It's written in Python + Kivy, so it runs under Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and MacOS! So far I can only offer packages for Android. Please help me packaging it for other Platforms.

### Run the Code ###

Dependencies:
* Python 2.7
* Kivy 1.8
