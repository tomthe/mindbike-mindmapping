Todo - Features
	support for keyboard-navigation
		how?
			keyboard-recognition is already implemented, I need functions like "select_son", select_brother_up, select_brother_down, select_father
			get the id of the apropiate node and
	rearrange map
		drag and drop nodes
		change order of sibblings
		change mother-node
	polish UI
		Map and notes:
			nicer colors, nicer buttons, white background?! configurable
			remove connection-line to root-node
			folding, editing, selecting, adding nodes:
				nicer buttons
				add buttons in the menu
				
		Menu:
			copy, cut, delete, add buttons
			add a nice, prebuild Android-like menu
	support and testing on various platforms
		Android
		Windows
		Linux
	support for notes and node-details
		complicated, because notes and details use html-syntax
 
Bugs

Ideas
	version-control
		safe the history of every node-action in a history-node
			this makes it possible to undo every action
		merging of two mindmaps with a common ancestor
	#tag-system/getting-things-done-implementation
		idea
			add tags to some nodes: "nodetext...blabla #tag"..."nodetext... #priority:high", " nodetext...#priority:low"...
			derive a new map from those tags:
				#tag....
				#priority
					#low
						"nodetext...#priority:low"
					#high
						....
	node-functions
